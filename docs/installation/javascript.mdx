Ditto's JavaScript SDK can run either in the browser, NodeJS, or Electron
environments. React Native support is currently under development. For more
information about browser, NodeJS and Electron support [click
here.](./supported-platforms)

1. Add the JS package with either npm or yarn.

<InstallCode framework="js" />

```
npm install --save @dittolive/ditto
# or with yarn
yarn add @dittolive/ditto
```

2. Import it like any other NPM package in your source and start using it:

```js
import { init, Ditto } from '@dittolive/ditto'

(async () => {
  await init() // you need to call this at least once before using any of the Ditto API
  const identity = { type: 'onlinePlayground', appID: 'com.example.ditto' }
  const ditto = new Ditto(identity, 'playground')
})()
```
