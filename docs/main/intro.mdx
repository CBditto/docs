Ditto is a cross-platform peer-to-peer database that allows apps to sync _with_ and _even without_ internet connectivity. 
Install Ditto into your application, then use the APIs to read and write data into its storage system, and it will then automatically sync any changes to other devices. Unlike other synchronization solutions, Ditto is designed for "peer-to-peer" synchronization where it can directly communicate with other devices even without an Internet connection. In addition, Ditto automatically manages the complexity of using multiple network transports, like Bluetooth, P2P Wi-Fi, and Local Area Network, to find and connect to other devices and then synchronize any changes.
