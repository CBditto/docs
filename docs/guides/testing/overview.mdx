Testing peer-to-peer systems can be challenging, but worth the initial effort to
ensure your data model works across multiple instances. It is important to test
your business logic with end-to-end unit tests that involve multiple Ditto peers. 

A typical test lifecycle is:

1. Create two instances of Ditto with the same identity and different directories.
2. Call `tryStartSync()` on both instances.
3. Listen for changes to data using `observe()` and write tests as a response to the `observe()` function.
4. Clean up Ditto directories between tests and stop any open syncronization
threads using `stopSync()`.

For complete examples and running tests, see the [open source samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/getditto/samples/tree/master/testing/).
