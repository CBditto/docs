There's no better "Hello World" for mobile apps than a good old Tasks or "To Do List" application. These tutorials will show you how to build a simple tasks application that can sync even without an internet connection. We've crafted these tutorials for multiple programming languages and frameworks. If you decide to build this app on multiple platforms, they will sync with each other as they will use the same collection name and document structure.
