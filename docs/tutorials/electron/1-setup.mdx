The following guide will show you how to build a task list application using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

Before starting this tutorial, you should install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.dev/). This tutorial was written with Node v16. In addition, you should have a decent familiarity with JavaScript.

## 1-1 Create the App

Once you've installed the latest version of Node LTS installed, start a new npm
project with:

```
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start-typescript tasks
cd tasks
npm i
```
