The authentication webhook needs to handle an __HTTP POST__ request. Each client
that will need to authenticate will send a payload to this webhook. The
following section requires that you have knowledge of writing server side HTTP
endpoints and responding with a JSON payload. Code samples of server side code
are written with a NodeJS / Express syntax. You can use any language or
framework on the server side. 

This section will not cover how to write server side code in depth or how to
deploy your server side. 

## Server 

First you must implement an HTTP endpoint that will take the JWT token, provider,
and appID and return the permissions granted for that user. 

### Incoming POST body

When your client device wants to authenticate using your webhook, your server will
receive an HTTP post with a JSON payload that looks like:

```jsonc 
{
  "appID": "YOUR_APP_ID_HERE", // the appID
  "provider": "my-auth", // this is the "Name" of the "Authentication Webhook"
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJI..." // this is what each device will send to authenticate
}
```

Your can introspect these values by parsing out the request body:

```js
let express = require('express')
let cors = require('cors')
let body = require('body-parser')
let app = express()

app.use(cors())
app.use(body.json())

let app = express()

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  const appID = req.body.appID
  const provider = req.body.provider
  const token = req.body.token
})
```

Generally, you will want to check the token for some sort of validity. Let's
assume you have some sort of library or logic to parse and validate the token is
for a specific user. 

You can also use the `userInfo` key in your JSON response to
pass information back to client.

```js
app.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const token = req.body.token;
  try {
    const { userId } = await checkToken(token)
    // payload = getDittoPermissions(userId)
    res.json(payload)
  } catch (err) {
    res.json({
      "authenticate": err,
      "userInfo": err.message
    }) 
  }
})
```

As a simple example, let's grant full `read` & `write` permissions to _all
collections_ and _all documents_. 

```js
app.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const token = req.body.token;
  try {
    let payload = {
      "authenticate": true,
      "expirationSeconds": 28800,
      "userID": "123abc",
      "permissions": {
        "read": {
          "everything": true,
          "queriesByCollection": {}
        },
        "write": {
          "everything": true,
          "queriesByCollection": {}
        }
      }
    }
    res.json(payload)
  } catch (err) {
    res.json({
      "authenticate": err,
      "userInfo": err.message
    }) 
  }
})

```

Permissions](/security/online-with-authentication/designing-permissions).

## Deploy your server

Now, the portal will attempt to reach this server. That means you must deploy it
somewhere that this HTTP request is accessible. For testing, you
can use a quick-deploy service such as [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

:::info
Please be sure that this endpoint is not behind a firewall or VPN.  If you
cannot get around this requirement [contact us](mailto:contact@ditto.live). 
:::

```js
app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log('server listening on ', process.env.PORT)
})
```

## Configure your Portal App

To use an "Online With Authentication" identity, go to your app in the [portal](https://portal.ditto.live/) and find the __Authentication Mode & Webhook Settings__ section. Ensure that __"With Authentication"__ is selected like so:

![Online With Authentication setting in Portal](./portal-with-authentication-setting.png)

Below, a section called __Authentication Webhooks__ will be editable. Once your Authentication Webhook Endpoint(s) is deployed and ready, you can register it in the portal. Add a __Name__ and __URL__. 

* The __Name__ is used the differentiate between multiple authentication. Most applications will have one authentication webhook, however the __Name__ parameter is still required. This name value is important for the next section.
* The __URL__ parameter is the fully qualified URL of the webhook that you deployed in the section above. Please include the protocol (_https:// or http://_ though we highly discourage
_http://_).
