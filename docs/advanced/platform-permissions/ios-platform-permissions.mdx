# iOS Platform Permissions

Ditto attempts to use all the available networking capabilities of your device to locate and sync with other users of your app. This includes standard Wi-Fi (which we often refer to as LAN or Local Area Network) and peer-to-peer functionality such as AWDL and Bluetooth Low Energy.

The iOS restrict access to some of this functionality for the sake of user control and privacy. To unlock the full capabilities of Ditto, it is important to configure your app so that it requests all the permissions that it needs. These permissions are only asked once when you attempt to start the synchronization.

Since iOS 13 and Xcode 11 an app must ask the user's permission to use Bluetooth. However, Ditto will activate Bluetooth by default, which means the user will receive a permission prompt automatically. In addition, since iOS 14 an app must ask the user's permission to use the Local Area Network to discover devices.

You must include several keys in the __Info.plist__ file your app

* Privacy - Local Network Usage Description
* Privacy - Bluetooth Peripheral Usage Description
* Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description
* A Bonjour service `_http-alt._tcp`.

You can configure these settings through Xcode's Info project settings.

Alternatively, add the keys directly to Info.plist. Right click on the Info.plist and hover to Open as and then click __Source Code__
