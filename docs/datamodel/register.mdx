Ditto documents support all primitive JSON compatible values like `string`, `boolean`,
`number`, and `null`. 

Registers in Ditto are *"Last Writer Wins"*. When a device updates a document,
the last write to the document will win. A timestamp is attached to each
update, and updates with later timestamps always win. To learn more about how
this works, read about Ditto's [Hybrid Logical
Clock](/how-it-works/crdt#hybrid-logical-clock).

        Arrays are an ordered list of values. Arrays can contain all primitive

        Sometimes referred to as a dictionary, a Map represents a nested object
        within the overall document. Comparing values at the map level for
        equality first checks that each key and each value match.

## How it works

Ditto uses a temporal timestamp called an HLC (hybrid logical clock) to
associate each register value with a time. When two registers are merged the
value with the highest timestamp wins.

For example, one attendant updates a customer's seat number to '6', and another to seat
'9'. When the two conflicting versions merge, the edit with the highest timestamp wins.

In that case that two updates occur at _exactly_ the same time, we use the unique ID of
the Ditto SDK to tie-break, preferring the highest ID.

In the case of a number like a seat number, a last-write-wins register is
a good choice, but some numbers represent quantities over time, and that is when
a [Counter](/datamodel/counter) is useful.
