Ditto offers an intermediate-level of security for applications where all users
and devices are trusted. For example, this could be appropriate for an
enterprise application run on centrally managed devices. In this mode, every
device knows the same secret key, and uses this to validate incoming
connections. The benefit of this approach is that distinct certificates do not
have to be distributed to every device, simplifying the deployment
considerations.

To generate a secure randomly generated shared key, use this command with OpenSSL:

*At time of writing, this command works on Linux machines with an up-to-date OpenSSL but not with the LibreSSL distributed on Macs.*
```console
openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -outform pem | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform der | base64 -w 0
```
