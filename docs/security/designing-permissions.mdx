Ditto identities use the following JSON to describe permissions attributed to a
particular `userID`, and accept or reject reads and writes from individual
clients. This information can be encoded within the certificate
[manually](/how-it-works/certificate-security) or with the [Online with Authentication
identity](/security/online-with-authentication/overview). When using
`onlineWithAuthentication`, Ditto sends an HTTP POST request to your server-side
authentication webhook. Your server should respond with the permissions granted
to that user.

## Rejecting a user

To reject a user, specify the JSON payload below. When using a webhook with `onlineWithAuthentication`, you do not need to manipulate the HTTP response status.

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": false
}
```

## Accepting a user

### The `permissions` response key

Access control describes what documents a user can or cannot read or write. Again, we leverage the existing [Ditto query language](/concepts/querying) to describe these rules. 

* `authenticate` to `true` to tell the webhook that the user has successfully validated
* `expirationSeconds` is `number` property on how long the authentication session is valid for before a refresh is required.
* `userID` is a `string` which identifies the the `userID`. This should be _unique_ across users within your app. 
* `permissions` which describes all the types of access control for collections and documents that this user can `read` or `write`

:::info
Currently, Ditto is only able to provide access control rules on document `_id` fields. It is not able to provide access control on mutable properties. However, we are working towards the ability to write access rules on all document properties.

### Granting full permissions on all collections and all documents

To grant full `read` permissions to _all collections_ and _all documents_:

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "expirationSeconds": 28800,
  "userID": "123abc",
  "permissions": {
    // highlight-start
    "read": {
      "everything": true,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    },
    "write": {
      "everything": false,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

To grant full `write` permissions to _all collections_ and _all documents_:

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "expirationSeconds": 28800,
  "userID": "123abc",
  "permissions": {
    "read": {
      "everything": false,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    },
    "write": {
      "everything": true,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    }
  }
}
```

To grant full `read` & `write` permissions to _all collections_ and _all documents_:

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "expirationSeconds": 28800,
  "userID": "123abc",
  "permissions": {
    "read": {
      "everything": true,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    },
    "write": {
      "everything": true,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Granting selective permissions on certain documents

To grant selective permissions on specific documents, add to the `queriesByCollection` property inside either the `read` or `write` property. Each key inside `queriesByCollection` is a reference to the collection. Each value is an array of [ditto queries](/concepts/querying) describing which documents the user can read or write.

:::info
Currently, you can __only specify a permission query on the `_id` field of a document__. Mutable properties are currently not supported. We are working on adding this feature.
:::

The following write permissions below describe that `userID: "123abc"` can

1. `write` to documents in the `"books"` collection where the `_id.title` value `endsWith('Potter')`.
2. `write` to any document in the `"newspapers"` collection. We use a single value of `true` 
3. `read` to documents in the `"books"` collection where the `_id.title` value `endsWith('Potter')`.

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "expirationSeconds": 28800,
  "userID": "123abc",
  "permissions": {
    "write": {
      "everything": false, // ensure that this is false
      "queriesByCollection": {
        // highlight-start
        // 1. 
        "books": [
          "endsWith(_id.title, 'Potter')"
        ],
        // highlight-end
        
        // highlight-start
        // 2. 
        "newspapers": [
          "true"
        ]
        // highlight-end
      }
    },
    "read": {
      "everything": false, // ensure that this is false
      "queriesByCollection": {
        // highlight-start
        // 3.
        "books": [
          "endsWith(_id.title, 'Potter')"
        ],
        // highlight-end
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here is a full example for a complex permissions query: 

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "identity": {
      "provider": "facebook",
      "id": true
  },
  "expirationSeconds": 3600,
  "permissions": {
      "read": {
          "everything": true,
          "queriesByCollection": {
              "cars": ["_id == 'my-specific-id'", "_id == 'id1' || _id == 'id2"],
              "boats": ["_id > 100", "_id > -10 && _id < 10"],
              "foods": ["_id == false"],
              "books": ["endsWith(_id, 'Potter')"]
          }
      },
      "write": {
          "everything": true,
          "queriesByCollection": {
              "cars": ["_id.price > 1500 && _id.currency == 'USD'", "_id.color == 'red"],
              "boats": ["regex(_id, '^Wave.*')"]
          }
      },
  }
}
```
