Most applications need way to control which users can write or read certain data. For example, you might build an application where senior staff members can `READ` and `WRITE` documents in the `"menuItems"` collection while junior staff members can only `READ`. This section will describe how you can:

1. Identify users 
2. Give users read or write control 
3. Integrate with your existing authentication systems

Ditto security is controlled by __identities__. An identity is a combination of a `userID` and a set of `permissions` that identifies how a Ditto instance behaves with other ditto instances. 

There are several types of identities, but for the vast majority of applications you should be familiar with two in particular:

* [Online Playground](/concepts/online-playground) - great for prototyping with Ditto. Beginners should start here!
* [Online With Authentication](/security/online-with-authentication/overview) - for apps that you'll deploy with authentication and customized permissioning with webhooks 

There are other identities geared towards peer-to-peer only scenarios. [You can read more about them here.](/security/identities)
