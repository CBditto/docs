## 1-1 Create Node.js Project

Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Ditto does not support the "Current" release.

```
❯ mkdir ditto-example
❯ cd ditto-example
❯ npm init
```


Optional: Configure typescript

```
❯ npm i -g typescript

added 1 package, and audited 2 packages in 2s

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

```
❯ tsc --init

Created a new tsconfig.json ...
```

## 1-2 Install Ditto

See the [installation page](../installation) for more information about platform compatibility.

```
npm i @dittolive/ditto
```

## 1-3 Initialize Ditto


Ditto is implemented using Rust and is bridged to JavaScript over WASM. That
means that you must initialize ditto first using `init()` as part of an async
context.

Create an `index.ts` file:

```js
import { init, Ditto } from '@dittolive/ditto'

async function main () {
  // Initialize the Ditto module
  await init()
}

main()
```   


Then, you can create a new Ditto instance. The `ditto` instance must stay in
scope for the duration of the program, otherwise it will be garbage collected.
To prevent garbage collection, make sure `ditto` is a global variable:

```js
import { init, Ditto } from '@dittolive/ditto'

//highlight-start
let ditto
//highlight-end

async function main () {
  await init()

  //highlight-start
  // Create a Ditto' context:
  const identity = { type: 'onlinePlayground', appID: 'YOUR_APP_ID', token: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'}
  ditto = new Ditto(identity)
  //highlight-end

  ditto.startSync()
}

main()
```   

Now you're ready to sync data!

## 1-4 Run the program

If you're using typescript, you must create the JavaScript file by running the following command:

```
tsc
```

Then, you can execute the file:

```
node index.js
```
