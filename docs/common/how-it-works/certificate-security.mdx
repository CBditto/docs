:::info
This section contains an advanced discussion of Ditto's underlying certificate, identity, and
encryption implementation. Most readers can skip this section.  However, if you are deploying an enterprise
on-premises deployment of Ditto, you may be required to reference the following
material.  
:::

All communications are consistently protected by modern and robust encryption
for all of Ditto's communication methods. Cryptographically-signed business
rules ensure users can only sync data that they are permitted to access. The app
developer is in complete control of the keys, certificates, and rules.

The Ditto Big Peer provisions signed x509 certificate. This certificate may then
be presented to other Ditto peers to mutually establish trust and create
encrypted communications channels. 
 
The following details information about the certificates used to encrypt the
communication channels.

## Identities

An identity is a bundle of device and app-specific information:

* Site ID - A number unique to this device.
* App Name - A name identifying the application. This avoids different Ditto-enabled apps trying to sync with each other. These are unique identifiers, for example, `5322afcd-5a70-43a3-bc2d-85d98ccf5ac0`
* Access Rules - Define which documents this device is allowed to read or write during sync.
* Private Key - A secret for authenticating as this identity.
* Identity Certificate - A certificate verifying the particulars of this device, signed by the CA.
* CA Certificate - Used to verify certificates presented by other devices with the same app.

## Certificate

Ditto identities and public keys are distributed in the standard X.509
certificate format. By default, these are distributed through the Ditto Portal.
They do not directly contain potentially sensitive data such as access rules,
but these can be defined by an authentication webhook with the 
[OnlineWithAuthentication identity](../security/designing-permissions), or by the
developer through the `Manual` identity.

When you are ready to use production identities, feel free to contact
us through the Ditto Portal and we will help you set up the right CA
tooling for your use case - or provide specifications so you can build your own.

## App-level Security

The access rules contained in the identity are rigid, signed by the central
certificate authority, and enforced by all participating devices. This offers
the highest level of security. If a person is not allowed to access particular
data, it will never be synced to their device.

For apps with weaker security requirements, a developer may choose to relax the
access rules for Ditto, then restrict access in their application code.

One advantage is that the developer has more flexibility to change the access
rules dynamically, since they are not encoded in signed certificates. Another
advantage is that all devices in the mesh can participate in syncing the data,
which may help it propagate faster. If certain data is only accessible to a few
privileged devices which are not often in range of each other, it will take
longer for them to sync.

The disadvantage is that an unprivileged user does have a device containing
privileged data. A technically savvy user or phone thief may be able to gain
access to not only their regular data, but also the more privileged data that
they were never intended to be able to view.

Therefore relaxed access rules - app-level security - are only suitable for
environments where there is a degree of trust that the devices won't end up
unlocked in the wrong hands.
