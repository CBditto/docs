Arrays are an ordered list of values. Arrays can contain all primitive
values. You cannot embed other CRDT types inside of an Array. In fact, the
Array itself is a register, which makes the behavior different than a typical Array.

### Use a Map instead
Ditto is a distributed database. Distributed databases work really well with
stable identifiers. Arrays are really challenging to use, because items are referenced
by their index. Indexes can change, which means indexes are not stable
identifiers. Two peers can see different values for the same index.
:::


Instead of an array, we recommend that you use a Map where:

* the **key** is a unique string, and
* the **value** is an object 

```
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "friends": {
        "abc123": { "id": "abc123", "name": "John" },
        "def456": { "id": "def456", "name": "Susan" }
    }
}
```

## Problem

If two devices have an instance of an array, and edit those arrays concurrently,
their changes may not merge.

For example, assume Device A and B both have the following document at T=1:

```jsonp
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "friends": [ "John", "Jacob", "Susan", "Alex" ]
}
```

When Device A and B disconnect from each other, they both update the list of friends:


Device A removes the item at index 1 at T=3:

```
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "friends": [ "John", "Susan", "Alex" ]
}
```

Device B removes the item at index 2 and adds a new item at T=2:

```jsonp
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "friends": [ "John", "Jacob", "Alex", "Rebecca" ]
}
```

Because the array is a last-write-wins register, Device A's version of the array
will "win." When they syncronize, both Device A and B will see:

```jsonp
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "friends": [ "John", "Susan", "Alex" ]
}
```

Device B's changes will be lost.

## Solution: Use a Map 

You can model a list of strings as a Map with the same behavior as a Set. Ditto
doesn't have the Set datatype yet. While we are working on releasing it, you can
implement that behavior using a Map.

Given the previous example document:

```jsonp
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "friends": [ "John", "Jacob", "Susan", "Alex" ]
}
```

We can convert our existing array to a Map where:

* the **key** is a unique string, and
* the **value** is an object 

### Example

Here is sample code that converts an existing Ditto document with an array to a Map. 

<SnippetGroup name="array-to-map" />

This code would result in a document that looks like this:

```
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "friends": {
        "abc123": { "id": "abc123", "name": "John" },
        "def456": { "id": "def456", "name": "Susan" }
    }
}
```
