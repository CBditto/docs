Ditto documents support all primitive JSON compatible types like `string`, `boolean`,
`number`, etc.

All primitive types in Ditto are internally represented as so
called [Registers](../how-it-works/crdt) with *"Last Writer Wins"* semantics.

When a device updates a document,
the last write to the document will win. A timestamp is attached to each
update, and updates with later timestamps always win. To learn more about how
this works, read about Ditto's [Hybrid Logical
Clock](../how-it-works/crdt#hybrid-logical-clock).

        Sometimes referred to as a dictionary, a Map represents a nested object
        within the overall document. Comparing values at the map level for
        equality first checks that each key and each value match.

## How it works

Ditto uses a temporal timestamp called an [HLC](../how-it-works/crdt#hybrid-logical-clock) (hybrid logical clock) to
associate each register value with a time. When two registers are merged the
value with the highest timestamp wins.

For example, one attendant updates a customer's seat number to '6', and another to seat
'9'. When the two conflicting versions merge, the edit with the highest timestamp wins.

In that case that two updates occur at _exactly_ the same time, we use the unique ID of
the Ditto SDK to tie-break, preferring the highest ID.

In the case of a number, like a seat number, a last-write-wins register is
a good choice. Some numbers represent quantities over time, and that is when
a [Counter](./counter) is useful.
