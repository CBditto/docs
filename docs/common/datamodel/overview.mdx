Each document in Ditto is a Map between a name (string) and a value. A value can be any other type supported in ditto, including Map. 

## Example

<SnippetGroup
  name='upsert-datatypes' 
/>


## Keys

Like JSON, Ditto only supports strings as keys in documents. That means attempting to insert a document like the following will throw an error:

```jsonc
{
    1: "numeric_keys_are_invalid",
    "this_part": "is_valid_though"
}
```

## Nested documents

Ditto does not support nesting documents. If you need to create relationships
between documents, use a foreign key relationship by referencing the `_id` of
the document. See [Creating Relationships Between Documents](../concepts/documents#creating-relationships-between-documents) for more information
