A Live Query Webhook allows you to respond to changes to data in real-time. It
is one way to implement CDC ([Change Data
Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture)) and is free for all
Ditto apps. For a more robust method, contact us to upgrade your organization for access to
[Kafka](../guides/kafka/intro).

## Creating a LiveQuery Webhook

First, you'll need a publicly accessible HTTPS route deployed on a domain of
your choice. For testing, you can use a service like
[Glitch](http://glitch.com). Your webhook will receive an HTTP POST request from the Ditto Big Peer.

## Configure the webhook

Login to the [Ditto Portal](https://portal.ditto.live/) and choose your app. 

**My App > Live Query Settings > Live Query Webhooks**

Type the name of the collection as well as the [query](../concepts/querying) you
want to monitor. You can use `true` to be notified of all changes to documents
within that collection.

## New document created

When a new document is created, `method` is `upsert` and the property `change.oldValue` will always be null.

:::info
Please take note of the `txnID` field which describes a timestamp of when the big peer internally replicated data modifications from small peers. This number is an always increasing value.
:::

```json
{
  "txnId": 552789,
  "type": "documentChanged",
  "collection": "people",
  "change": {
    "method": "upsert",
    "oldValue": null,
    "newValue": {
      "_id": "6213e9c90012e4af0017cb9f",
      "date": 1645472201,
      "name": "Susan",
      "age": 31
    }
  }
}
```

## Update

When a document was updated, `method` is `upsert`, `change.oldValue` will contain the old version of the document and `change.newValue` contains the full document after the upsert was complete. `newValue` also includes all properties that did not change as a result of this operation. For example, even though we do not change "age" in the following example, we still see `age`. 

After updating the document `6213e9c90012e4af0017cb9f` with the properties:
```
{
  ownedCars: 0, 
  friends: [], 
  name: "Frank"
}
```

We will see the following JSON event stream through the Kafka console:

```json
{
  "txnId": 553358,
  "type": "documentChanged",
  "collection": "people",
  "change": {
    "method": "upsert",
    "oldValue": {
      "_id": "6213e9c90012e4af0017cb9f",
      "date": 1645472312,
      "name": "Susan",
      "age": 31
    },
    "newValue": {
      "_id": "6213e9c90012e4af0017cb9f",
      "date": 1645472312,
      "name": "Frank",
      "age": 31,
      "ownedCars": 0,
      "friends": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Remove

When a document was removed, `method` is `remove`, and the property `change.value` contains the full document at the time it was removed. 

```json
{
  "txnId": 701251,
  "type": "documentChanged",
  "collection": "people",
  "change": {
    "method": "remove",
    "value": {
      "_id": "6213e9c90012e4af0017cb9f",
      "date": 1645468039,
      "name": "Susan",
      "age": 31 
    }
  }
}
```
