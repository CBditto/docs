A write transaction allows a device to perform multiple operations within a
single database call. You can perform insert, update, remove or evict operations
on multiple collections more efficiently using this method.

:::warning
You must use the scoped collection within a write transaction, as in the above example. For example, `txn.scoped("collection_name").find(query).exec()`.

Using `ditto.store.collection(...)` will cause a panic at runtime.
