Removes will delete or remove one or more documents from the collection. Calling
remove __will sync removals to the local device and to other devices as well__. 

:::danger
Removing documents will remove documents from the local device _and other
peers_. Your application code should consider `remove`  calls to be destructive.
In other words, if you call remove on document, your application should consider
this document _gone_ throughout your system. You can not add a document with the
same `_id` at a later time.

### Remove by _id

Removing by document _id is permaent. You can not add a document with the
same `_id` at a later time.

<SnippetGroup
  name='remove-id' 
/>

### Archiving documents

Consider using a "soft-delete" pattern in your application for most use cases.
For example, use a field like `isArchived: true` and query for documents to
represent a "soft-delete". 

```json
{
  "_id": "123abc",
  "name": "Foo",
  "isArchived": true // add this field
}
```

And query non-archived documents like so:

```js
let liveQuery = ditto
  .store.collection('cars')
  .find('!isArchived').observe((documents) => {
    console.log('these are the unarchived documents', documents)
  })
```

You can easily un-archive these documents by calling update on that field like so:

```js
ditto.store.collection('cars').update((mutableDoc) => {
  mutableDoc["isArchived"] = false
})
```
