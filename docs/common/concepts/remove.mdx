## Removing Documents

Removes will delete or remove one or more documents from the collection. Calling remove __will sync removals to the local device and to other devices as well__. 


:::danger

Removing documents will remove documents from the local device _and other peers_. Your application code should consider `remove`  calls to be destructive. In other words, if you call remove on document, your application should consider this document _gone_ throughout your system.

__Alternatively:__ consider using a "soft-delete" pattern in your application for most use cases. For example, use a field like `isArchived: true` and query for documents to represent a "soft-delete". 

```json
{
  "_id": "123abc",
  "name": "Foo",
  "isArchived": true // add this field
}
```

And query non-archived documents like so:

```js
let liveQuery = ditto
  .store.collection('cars')
  .find('isArchived == $args.isArchived', { isArchived: false }).observe((documents) => {
    console.log('these are the unarchived documents', documents)
  })
```

You can easily un-archive these documents by calling update on that field like so:

```js
ditto.store.collection('cars').update((mutableDoc) => {
  mutableDoc["isArchived"] = false
})
```

### Removing by `_id`

<SnippetGroup
  name='remove-id' 
/>


### Removing by query

You can also remove several documents with a query string. This example will
remove all documents in the collection that match the given query string.


<SnippetGroup
  name='remove-query' 
/>
