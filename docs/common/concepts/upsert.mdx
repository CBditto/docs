## Upserting Documents

 __Upserting__ describes a behavior where you would want to insert a document into a collection if the document `_id` does not not exist.
 
<SnippetGroup name="upsert" />

### Upserting with a specific `_id`

There are times where you want to specify the `_id` of the document before upsertion.  If the `_id` exists, Ditto will update the document in place. Note that the `_id` is immutable. This means that you cannot change the `_id` once you have upserted the document.

As an example, let's say we have a document in the `people` collection that looks like this:

```jsonc
{
  "_id": "123abc",
  "name": "Sam",
  "age": 45,
  "isOnline": false
}
```

<SnippetGroup
  name='upsert-id' 
/>


### Default Data

Default Data can be thought of as "placeholder" data.  Default Data is useful when your app needs to load "starter" data from an external data source, like from a backend API, on multiple devices without creating odd "overwriting" behavior.

Ditto's approach to conflict resolution orders changes by time. In most situations, this leads to predictable behavior. However, if your application is upserting the same initial data into multiple devices, such as common data from a central backend API, this could result in overwriting later changes:

1. Device A upserts a document `{"firstName": "Adam"}` at time = 0 after downloading from a central API.
2. Device A updates the document to `{"firstName": "Max"}` at time = 1.
3. Device B synchronizes with Device A receiving the document `{"firstName": "Max"}` at time = 2.
4. Device B downloads the same document from the backend API `{"firstName": "Adam"}` and upserts at t = 3, which overwrites the previous change synced at time = 1.

In the above example, both Device A and B want to preserve the change by Device A that occurred after downloading the common data. To do so, Ditto offers an additional parameter: isDefault.
