You can describe permissions attributed using a JSON
document. This JSON document is encoded within the certificate used by each
device. Each peer verifies the cerificates of other peers, and accepts or rejects reads
and writes based on these permissions.

For example, 

You can issue each certificiate [manually](../how-it-works/certificate-security) or with the [Online with
Authentication identity](../security/online-with-authentication). 

## Rejecting a user

To reject a user from reading or writing at all, specify the JSON payload below.

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": false
}
```

## Accepting a user

To grant full `read` & `write` permissions to _all collections_ and _all documents_:

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "expirationSeconds": 28800,
  "userID": "123abc",
  "permissions": {
    "read": {
      "everything": true,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    },
    "write": {
      "everything": true,
      "queriesByCollection": {}
    }
  }
}
```

* `authenticate` to `true` to tell the webhook that the user has successfully validated
* `expirationSeconds` is `number` property on how long the authentication session is valid for before a refresh is required.
* `userID` is a `string` which identifies the the `userID`. This should be _unique_ across users within your app. 
* `permissions` which describes all the types of access control for collections and documents that this user can `read` or `write`



## Access Control Permissions

:::info
Currently, you can __only specify a permission query on the `_id` field of a
document__. Mutable properties are currently not supported. We are working on
adding this feature.  
:::

To grant selective permissions on specific documents, add to the
`queriesByCollection` property inside either the `read` or `write` property.
Each key inside `queriesByCollection` is a reference to the collection. Each
value is an array of [ditto queries](../concepts/querying) describing which
documents the user can read or write.


### Example

The following write permissions below describe that `userID: "123abc"` can

1. `write` to documents in the `"books"` collection where the `_id.title` value `endsWith('Potter')`.
2. `write` to any document in the `"newspapers"` collection. We use a single value of `true` 
3. `read` to documents in the `"books"` collection where the `_id.title` value `endsWith('Potter')`.

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "expirationSeconds": 28800,
  "userID": "123abc",
  "permissions": {
    "write": {
      "everything": false, // ensure that this is false
      "queriesByCollection": {
        // highlight-start
        // 1. 
        "books": [
          "endsWith(_id.title, 'Potter')"
        ],
        // highlight-end
        
        // highlight-start
        // 2. 
        "newspapers": [
          "true"
        ]
        // highlight-end
      }
    },
    "read": {
      "everything": false, // ensure that this is false
      "queriesByCollection": {
        // highlight-start
        // 3.
        "books": [
          "endsWith(_id.title, 'Potter')"
        ],
        // highlight-end
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here is a full example for a complex permissions query: 

```jsonc
{
  "authenticate": true,
  "identity": {
      "provider": "facebook",
      "id": true
  },
  "expirationSeconds": 3600,
  "permissions": {
      "read": {
          "everything": true,
          "queriesByCollection": {
              "cars": ["_id == 'my-specific-id'", "_id == 'id1' || _id == 'id2"],
              "boats": ["_id > 100", "_id > -10 && _id < 10"],
              "foods": ["_id == false"],
              "books": ["endsWith(_id, 'Potter')"]
          }
      },
      "write": {
          "everything": true,
          "queriesByCollection": {
              "cars": ["_id.price > 1500 && _id.currency == 'USD'", "_id.color == 'red"],
              "boats": ["regex(_id, '^Wave.*')"]
          }
      },
  }
}
```
