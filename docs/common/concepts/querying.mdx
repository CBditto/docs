Ditto provides a robust query engine that supports different filter operations. At a high-level, all queries work on a specific collection and are used to filter the collection. In addition, since Ditto works with data represented in JSON-compatible documents, the query syntax offers dot notation to reference keys within the document tree as shown below:

<SnippetGroup
  name='query-basic' 
/>


## Navigating Document Properties

To refer to keys within the document's property tree, Ditto uses dot notation that should be familiar to most developers. Let's say we have a document like so:


```json
{
   "_id": "123abc",
   "name": { "first": "Alan", "last": "Turing" },
   "contact": { "phone": { "type": "cell", "number": "111-222-3333" } },
   "work": { "street-line": "678 Johnson Street"}
}
```

If you wanted to query for the `lastName` property nested in `name` with the following document contents

```js
find("name.last == 'Turing'")
```

Keys in the query syntax by default must be alphanumeric or include underscore (a-zA-Z0-9_). In addition, the key must start with an alpha characters first (a-zA-Z_). If your key uses another character, such as a hyphen, you must use a __brack syntax__. To query for th `"street-line"` property underneath `"work"`, you will need to do the following: 

```js
find("work['street-line'] == '678 Johnson Street'")
```

## Using query variables with `$args` 

Often, you will query with runtime variables. Instead of building or
interpolating query strings, the query system will accept variables through an
`$args` dictionary object.

  name='query-args' 
/>


## Query Conditions

The Ditto query language is very similar to what you'd write in most `if` statements. In addition, we offer standard, easy-to-understand query condition operators that most developers should understand.


### Equality `==`, Inequality

```js
// finds documents which have a title equal to Harry Potter.
find("title == $args.title", { title: 'Harry Potter' })

// finds documents which that are not of the title Lord of the Rings
find("title != $args.title", { title: 'Lord of the rings' })
```

### Comparisons - Greater Or Less Than `>=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`


```js
// finds documents where the age is less than or equal to 18
find("age <= $args.age", { age: 18})
// finds documents where the age is less than to 18
find("age < $args.age", { age: 18})
// finds documents where the age is greater than or equal to 18
find("age >= $args.age", { age: 18})
// finds documents where the age is greater than to 18
find("age > $args.age", { age: 18})
```

### Compound - And `&&`, Or `||`, Not `!`, Contains `contains`


Use `&&` for a logical __and__ Predicate; similar to SQLite's AND
```js
// finds documents that have a theme property equal to "Dark" and a name property equaly to "Light"
find("theme == 'Dark' && name == 'Light'")
```

Use `||` for a logical __or__ predicate; similar to SQL OR statements
```js
// finds documents that are "Tom" or "Arthur"
find("name == 'Tom' || name == 'Arthur'")
```

Use `!` for a logical __not__ predicate; similar to SQL NOT statements

```js
// finds documents that are neither "Hamilton" nor "Morten"
find("!(name == 'Hamilton' || name == 'Morten')")
```

Use `contains(array, value)` to check an if an array contains a value. 

```js
// finds documents who have a `connectionType` property and checks if it equals any of the values in a defined array
find("contains(['bluetooth', 'wifidirect'], connectionType)")
```


### String Operations

Use `starts_with(property, test)` to test if a property with a string value __starts__ with a test string

```js
// finds documents with a title property that begins with "Lord"
find("starts_with(title, 'Lord')")
```

Use `ends_with(property, test)` to test if a property with a string value __ends__ with a test string

```js
// finds documents with a title property that ends with "Lord"
find("ends_with(title, 'Rings')")
```

Use `regex(property, test)` to see if a property with a string value passes a [Regular Expression. Click here for a reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions). 

```js
// finds documents which has a title property that only comprises of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. 
find("regex(title, '^([A-Za-z]|[0-9]|_)+$')")

// A title property of "abc129_24A" will pass
// A title property of "abc129_24A  3" will not pass
```

Queries also parse ISO-8601 date strings as comparable dates

```js
find("created_at >= $args.date", { date: "2022-04-29T00:55:31.859Z"})
```

## Sort

Before executing a query, you can specify to sort on a specific property. Call `sort` before a query is executed by specifying a specific property and a sort direction. 

Note: Queries that do not specify a `sort` will assume to sort on the `_id` property.

The following example will sort on documents that have a mileage property

<SnippetGroup
  name='query-sort' 
/>

## Limit 

There are times where you need to limit the number of results that a query. Call `limit` before the query is executed to trim the number of results. This is best used with `sort`.

<SnippetGroup
  name='query-limit' 
/>
