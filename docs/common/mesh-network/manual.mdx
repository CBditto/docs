There are instances where you may want to configure additional connections configurations for the current Ditto instance. This section will teach you how to configure your Ditto instance to listen for connections on a port explicitly and to connect to remote instances via a host (IP) and port. To do this, _before_ you call `tryStartSync()`, construct a `DittoTransportConfig` value and set `ditto.SetTransportConfig`.

:::info
Ditto will automatically attempt to connect to other ditto instances on
the Local Area Network, Bluetooth, and AWDL. However, if you supply a
`DittoTransportConfig`, this will not automatically be enabled. You'll need to
remember to enable peer to peer connnections with `EnableAllPeerToPeer()`.

## Observing Peers 

There could be a situation where you need to know the device name, metadata,
transport and connection type about other peers and devices in the mesh network.
You can manually set the device name of those peers and the device name will
propagate to all other connected peers. This function is used to gather the
metadata needed to render the Ditto Presence Viewer.

## Connecting to a Remote Ditto Peer

If you know the host and port of another remote Ditto peer and would like to connect to it, construct a `DittoTransportConfig` object and add the host and port to the `DittoTransportConfig.Connect.TcpServers` property as a `string`. The string format should be `host:port`, separated by a colon.

In the example below, we know of two other Ditto peers located on:

* Host IP `135.1.5.5` at port `12345`
* Host IP `185.1.5.5` at port `4567`


<SnippetGroup name="network-remote-ditto" />

Feel free to add as many known remote `host:port` strings.

## Listening for Connections on a Specific Port

You can enable the Ditto instance to listen for incoming connections from other
remotes Ditto peers on a specific port. You can think of this as setting up your
Ditto as a "server" that can listen to connections from other peers.

In this example, we would like our Ditto instance to listen to _incoming_ connections on port `4000` on `0.0.0.0`. 

:::info
To be safe, please do not use `localhost` when setting the IP interface. Use `"0.0.0.0"` instead.

Incoming connections from other Ditto peers will be able to connect only if the
port is accessible. Depending on your deployment _be sure to check that external
connections can reach the port_ that you have specified in your configuration.
You may need to set up port forwarding if external ports map differently to your
host.

## Combining Multiple Transports

You can specify several modes of transport configuration within `DittoTransportConfig`. The following snippet shows you a ditto instance that can:

1. Connect to local area network devices
2. Listen for incoming remote connections
3. Connect to remote devices with a known host and port.

## Monitoring Transport Conditions

If syncing over Bluetooth LE is a critical part of your application you may want
to warn the user if they are missing the permission or if the hardware is
disabled. Ditto will help you by reporting conditions via a delegate or callback
object.

First, while configuring Ditto, assign a delegate or a callback to receive notifications.
