Ditto is a cross-platform peer to peer database that allows apps to sync with and even without internet connectivity. Simply install the SDK into your application, then use the APIs to read and write data into its storage system, and it will then automatically sync any changes to other devices. Unlike other synchronization solutions, Ditto is designed for "peer-to-peer" synchronization where it can directly communicate with other devices, no server required! The SDK automatically manages the complexity of using multiple network transports, like Bluetooth and Wifi, to find and connect to other devices and then synchronize any changes.
