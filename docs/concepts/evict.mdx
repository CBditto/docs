## Evicting Data

There are times where you want to remove data _without_ syncing the delete operation. This operation is different than remove in that it only removes one of more documents from the local storage and **does not sync the change to other devices.**

For example, you might use this operation when a device has completed an activity that involved synchronizing data with other devices and has transmitted the data to a backend. At this point, the device can evict the data locally to free up storage, but it does not want to remove the data from any other device.

The API is extremely similar to the `remove()` API, however it uses `evict()` instead.
