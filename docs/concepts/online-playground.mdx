  When you install Ditto in a client device like a web, desktop, mobile,
  or IoT application, you are installing a __Small Peer__. Running on the cloud is
  a __Big Peer__. While it still looks like any peer, underneath the hood, a Big
  Peer is capable of scaling to meet the demands of large amount of data.

## Online Playground

To get started, you can syncronize with the Ditto Big Peer using
the **Online Playground** . These apps can sync with the Big Peer if
they have the same `appID`.  Online Playground applications have __no
restrictions to data__ and each peer is
randomly assigned a unique `userID`. Online playgrounds are perfect for learning
about how to use Ditto's APIs without worrying about security architecture.

* Apps with Online Playground can read and write to all collections.
* Apps with Online Playground will connect to other peer devices or a Big Peer app with __same appID__.

:::caution
__DO NOT__ ship an application to production with Online Playground. We call
this a Playground because it's meant for getting started quickly without having to implement
security. 

For using the Big Peer with an OAuth client suitable for production, use 
[Online With Authentication](/security/online-with-authentication/overview).
:::

## Get your appID

To find your **appID**, go to your app in the Ditto portal and find the __Authentication Mode & Webhook Settings__ section. Ensure that __"Playground"__ is selected like so:
