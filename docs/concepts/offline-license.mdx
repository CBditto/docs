If your app needs to sync data without using the Ditto Big Peer, you will have to
request a Ditto Offline License Token for your app. These license tokens can
be used with [OfflinePlayground](/concepts/offline-license#offline-playground), [Manual](/how-it-works/certificate-security), and [SharedKey](/security/shared-key) identities.

## Request a license 

To request a license, go to your app in the Ditto portal and find the
__Offline License Tokens__ section. Press the **Request offline license** button
to get started. Your license request will be sent to a Ditto engineer and we
will soon contact you in order to generate an offline license for your app. Your
license will appear here once it has been generated.
